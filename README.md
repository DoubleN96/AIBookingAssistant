## Problem

To add confidence to the customer normally a sales rep is needed for conferences or a booking agency to close de booking, that is more common in mid-term booking 
(>1 Month)

There is 3 parts of the Life Cycle of a customer booking process:

1. Pre- Booking. The customer is looking for information and comparison and needs confidence to book and decide about the booking details.
2. Booked, during the stay. He is already in the room, so he will need info about the surrounding areas, things to do, reporting issues.
3. Post booking. Ask him for review, and he can also ask for his guarantee deposit to be back. It will guide the customer towards the booking procedure.

## Solution

We decided to use OpenAI Whisper because it is a powerful natural language processing tool that has a lot of potential to enhance the room rental experience. While it may not have direct implications to the room rental, we combined it with other technologies to create a more seamless and user-friendly experience for renters during the booking procedure.

1. Conversational Booking: Room rental companies could incorporate out tool into their chatbot or virtual assistant to enable users to book a room through a natural language conversation. This helps to simplify the booking process and make it more efficient for users.

2. Personalized Recommendations: By using OpenAI Whisper we help to generate personalized recommendations for room rental based on a user's preferences and past behavior, companies could improve customer satisfaction and create a more enjoyable rental experience for their users.

3. Intelligent Search: Room rental platforms could leverage OpenAI Whisper to improve their search functionality by allowing users to search for rooms using natural language queries. This could make it easier for users to find the right room for their needs and create a more streamlined search experience.
